                <p>
                    Athenis was built on a robust and modern technical stack that integrates several powerful tools and frameworks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>React:</strong> A popular JavaScript library used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allowed for the efficient development and maintenance of complex UI elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Astro:</strong> A modern static site generator that powers our landing page with optimal performance and fast load times. Astro enables the integration of multiple frameworks and optimizes content delivery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>GPT Integrations:</strong> We integrated GPT models to drive the AI chatbot functionality, enabling natural language processing and interactive learning assistance. This integration allowed the platform to offer real-time, context-aware responses to user inquiries.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These technologies not only enhanced the performance and scalability of the platform but also provided a solid foundation for iterative improvements and future expansions.

                <h2>UX/UI Methodologies and Best Practices</h2>
                <p>
                    Delivering a seamless and engaging user experience in an e-learning environment requires a deep understanding of user needs and behaviors. For Athenis, we employed several best practices and methodologies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>User Research:</strong> Conducting extensive user interviews and surveys to gather insights into learner preferences and challenges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Persona Development:</strong> Creating detailed user personas to represent the diverse audience of the platform, ensuring that design decisions catered to real-world needs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Iterative Design and Prototyping:</strong> Utilizing low-fidelity wireframes for rapid prototyping, followed by high-fidelity designs to refine visual elements and interactions. This iterative approach ensured continuous feedback and improvement throughout the design process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Regularly testing prototypes with actual users to identify usability issues and refine workflows, ensuring an intuitive and accessible experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accessibility Standards:</strong> Adhering to WCAG guidelines to create an inclusive platform that is accessible to users with disabilities.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These methodologies not only streamlined our design process but also ensured that the final product was both aesthetically pleasing and functionally robust.

                <h2>Collaboration and Team Dynamics</h2>
                <p>
                    The development of Athenis was a collaborative effort involving a dedicated, international team of approximately ten professionals based in El Salvador, Colombia, Argentina, and Mexico. Despite the project being entirely volunteer-based and conducted remotely, our team employed agile methodologies, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and iterative reviews, to ensure smooth collaboration and timely delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working in a diverse, cross-cultural team not only enriched the project with varied perspectives but also enhanced our ability to innovate and solve complex problems. This collaborative spirit was instrumental in achieving significant milestones, such as winning the IFE 2024 award, securing funding from Tecnológico de Monterrey, and attracting angel investors from Spain.

                    <li><strong>Award Winner:</strong> Recognized with the IFE 2024 award for innovation in educational technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional Funding:</strong> Received financial support from Tecnológico de Monterrey, validating the platform's potential.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although I ultimately decided to move on to personal projects that align with my career goals and provide financial stability, the experience gained from working on Athenis has been invaluable. It has enriched my expertise in UX/UI design, cross-functional collaboration, and the integration of advanced technologies in education.
